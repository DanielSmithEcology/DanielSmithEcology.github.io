In ecology, researchers often talk about two types of competition: exploitative competition and interference competition. Exploitative competition refers *indirect* competition between (or within) species for mutually shared resources. Interference competition refers to *direct* interactions between organisms (e.g., stealing resources in contests, territoriality, stabbing and toxin-antitoxin systems in microbes). 

The majority of "mechanistic" models and theories in community ecology -- such as R* theory and the R* rule -- emphasize exploitative competition and ignore interference competition. In contrast, the Hawk-Dove game from evolutionary game theory is a classic model in which interference competition is emphasized. Similarly, the competition-colonization trade-off is a classic coexistence mechanism in theoretical community ecology which implicitly relies on interference competition, at least within certain interpretations. However, R* theory, the Hawk-Dove game, and the competition-colonization trade-off have not been integrated into a unified framework.

In [our recent paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559600) currently under review, [Dr. Joanna Masel](https://www.masellab.org/people/joanna-masel) and I expand a simple exploitative consumer-resource model to include interference competition over resources. As depicted in the figure below, we consider a model in which one individuals (e.g., the deer) may contest others over the use of resources. Through this model, we find that two consumer species can persist on a single limiting resource due to interference (in contrast to classical ecological theory such as the R* rule). We find that some of the parameter space resembles the R* rule, other parts resemble the Hawk-Dove game, and other parts the competition-colonization trade-off. We also find evidence of novel coexistence mechanism which we refer to as the "submission-discovery" trade-off. 

In upcoming work, we will expand this model to include trait evolution. We aim to elucidate how interference competition modifies niche evolution and character displacement.
