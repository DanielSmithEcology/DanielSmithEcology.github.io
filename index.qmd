# ðŸŒ³ About me ðŸŒ±

I am a theoretical ecologist and evolutionary biologist. 

Just as a microscope can reveal the inner-workings of a cell, mathematics can illuminate the processes that shape ecological communities and evolutionary adaptation. In my work, I emphasize the use of mathematical models to explore how density-dependent interactions shape ecological patterns such as species diversity, often in conjunction with empirical data. 

I am currently a Peter O'Donnell Jr. Postdoc Fellow at UT Austin, working closely with [Dr. Annette Ostling](https://sites.google.com/utexas.edu/ostlinglab/home?authuser=0) and [Dr. Brian Sedio](http://briansedio.weebly.com/). I was previously a Postdoc in [Dr. Joanna Masel's lab](https://www.masellab.org/people/joanna-masel). I received my PhD from the University of Chicago, where I was advised by [Dr. Tim Wootton](https://voices.uchicago.edu/woottonlab/). I also previously worked with [Dr. Priyanga Amarasekare ](https://faculty.eeb.ucla.edu/amarasekare/index.html) as an undergraduate at UCLA. 

On this website, you will find descriptions of my research, publications, talks, outreach, and teaching.
