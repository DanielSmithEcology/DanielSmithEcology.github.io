The term "fitness" is thrown around all the time in ecology and evolutionary biology. But what does it exactly mean? This kind of question calls for a philosopher (which I am *not*). To get at this question, [Dr. Joanna Masel](https://www.masellab.org/people/joanna-masel) and I teamed up with some philosophers to investigate! Ultimately, we propose that there are two different "types" of fitness evolutionary biologists refer to in models: (1) short-term fitness, which are summaries of vital rates (e.g., the Malthusian parameter) and (2) long-term fitness (e.g., the probability an allele fixes in a population). The below figures summarizes our view of fitness and its operationalizations. [See our preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559600) for details.

Here is a [link to an excellant talk by Dr. Joanna Masel  ](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24htp001/videos/watch/202405211351-Masel.html) on this project and related works that elegantly summarizes many of our views.
