## YouTube

I am the creator of the YouTube channel [LifeEquations](https://www.youtube.com/@LifeEquationsVideos). In each video, I (attempt to) explain a complex theoretical topic or model in ecology in simple terms. 

Here's my latest video:

And here are several other ecology-related videos from the channel!

## Reshaping quantiative education in the biological sciences

At the inaugural meeting of the Society for Modeling and Theory in Population Biology in Banff (Alberta, Canada), we formed a committee to enact change in teaching the biological sciences. Our primary goals is to better integrate mathematical and quantitative reasoning into biological curriculums in higher education. For information about the society can be found [here.](https://smtpb.wildapricot.org/)
