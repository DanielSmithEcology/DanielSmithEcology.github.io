Exploitative competition refers *indirect* competition between (or within) species for mutually shared resources. Interference competition refers to *direct* interactions between organisms (e.g., stealing resources in contests, territoriality, stabbing and toxin-antitoxin systems in microbes). \n\nThe majority of \"mechanistic\" models and theories in community ecology -- such as R* theory and the R* rule -- emphasize exploitative competition and ignore interference competition. In contrast, the Hawk-Dove game from evolutionary game theory is a classic model in which interference competition is emphasized. Similarly, the competition-colonization trade-off is a classic coexistence mechanism in theoretical community ecology which implicitly relies on interference competition, at least within certain interpretations. However, R* theory, the Hawk-Dove game, and the competition-colonization trade-off have not been integrated into a unified framework. \n\n<img src=\"Interference_Comp.png\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain\" onclick=\"window.open('https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559600', 'blank');\"/>\n  <font size=\"2.5\"> (A) is a visualization of the model, depicting a single species that consumes resources and engages in contests over resources.

As depicted in the figure below, we consider a model in which one individuals (e.g., the deer) may contest others over the use of resources. Through this model, we find that two consumer species can persist on a single limiting resource due to interference (in contrast to classical ecological theory such as the R* rule). We find that some of the parameter space resembles the R* rule, other parts resemble the Hawk-Dove game, and other parts the competition-colonization trade-off. We also find evidence of novel coexistence mechanism which we refer to as the \"submission-discovery\" trade-off. \n\nIn upcoming work, we will expand this model to include trait evolution. We aim to elucidate how interference competition modifies niche evolution and character displacement. \n\n\n----\n",
