This kind of question calls for a philosopher (which I am not). To get at this question, Dr. Joanna Masel and I teamed up with some philosophers to investigate! Ultimately, we propose that there are two different “types” of fitness evolutionary biologists refer to in models: (1) short-term fitness, which are summaries of vital rates (e.g., the Malthusian parameter) and (2) long-term fitness (e.g., the probability an allele fixes in a population). The below figures summarizes our view of fitness and its operationalizations. See our preprint for details.\n Our “fitness” schematic.

    "section": "🦅 How interfernece competition affects coexistence 🕊",
    "text": "🦅 How interfernece competition affects coexistence 🕊\nIn ecology, researchers often talk about two types of competition: exploitative competition and interference competition. Exploitative competition refers indirect competition between (or within) species for mutually shared resources. Interference competition refers to direct interactions between organisms (e.g., stealing resources in contests, territoriality, stabbing and toxin-antitoxin systems in microbes).\nThe majority of “mechanistic” models and theories in community ecology – such as R* theory and the R* rule – emphasize exploitative competition and ignore interference competition. In contrast, the Hawk-Dove game from evolutionary game theory is a classic model in which interference competition is emphasized. Similarly, the competition-colonization trade-off is a classic coexistence mechanism in theoretical community ecology which implicitly relies on interference competition, at least within certain interpretations. However, R* theory, the Hawk-Dove game, and the competition-colonization trade-off have not been integrated into a unified framework.\nIn our recent paper currently under review, Dr. Joanna Masel and I expand a simple exploitative consumer-resource model to include interference competition over resources. As depicted in the figure below, we consider a model in which one individuals (e.g., the deer) may contest others over the use of resources. Through this model, we find that two consumer species can persist on a single limiting resource due to interference (in contrast to classical ecological theory such as the R* rule). We find that some of the parameter space resembles the R* rule, other parts resemble the Hawk-Dove game, and other parts the competition-colonization trade-off. We also find evidence of novel coexistence mechanism which we refer to as the “submission-discovery” trade-off.\n (A) is a visualization of the model, depicting a single species that consumes resources and engages in contests over resources. (B) shows parameter space in which interference competition may permit coexistence of two consumer species competing for a single limiting resource (first row) and the predominant mechanism underlying the competitive outcome (second row).  Link to article on BioRxiv\nIn upcoming work, we will expand this model to include trait evolution. We aim to elucidate how interference competition modifies niche evolution and character displacement."

    "text": "🪲 The effect of temperature on competition in ectotherms 🌡️\nMy first research project concerned how temperature affects coexistence in ectotherms (e.g., insects, reptiles, amphibians, fish). I performed this research with Dr. Priyanga Amarasekare.\nIn this project, we first built a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations describing exploitative competition between two ectotherm consumers sharing a single resource (see “The model” in the below figure and see the paper for more details). Importantly, key vital rates of ectotherms exhibit well-characterized responses to temperature (e.g., consumer attack rate / birth rate and mortality rate; see “thermal response of parasitoids”, panels a-d for an example). We then asked the question: “if we include seasonal temperature variation, when might the two consumer species coexist?” and derived conditions under which we expect deterministic coexistence in the model.\n The left-hand equations show the system of ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the Resource (\\(R\\)), Consumer 1 (\\(C_1\\)) and Consumer 2 (\\(C_2\\)). a-d show the thermal responses of the two egg parasitoids (Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii). a and b show how per capita egg attack rates respond to temperature; c and d show how temperature affects mortality. e and f are plots depicting the region of coexistence for the parasitoids; the blue point shows the model parameterized with the the data in a-d. g and h show the time series from (g) the parameterized model and (h) data from the field.  Link to article published in The American Naturalist\nWe then applied the model to a naturally occurring insect community: the harlequin bug (Murgantia histrionica) and its two egg parasitoids (Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii) which compete in the wild (see the above figure, panels a-d for visualizations of how temperature affects the parasitoids’ vital rates). We find that the conditions for coexistence in the model are realized when parameterized with the measured temperature response of parasitoids (see the blue dot in panels e-f). Furthermore, the parameterized model gives a time series output for the parasitoids abundances (panel g) that is very similar to the parasitoid abundances measured in the field (panel h)."

    "text": "🦠 Natural enemies and plant diversity 🌱\nHistorically, work in community ecology focused on species interactions that take place within a defined environment that exists independent of the species – in other words, species have been figuratively treated like actors upon an environmental stage that preexists them. This view is no longer substantiated: recent decades have seen an explosion of research into how organisms shape their environments.\nOne such process involves plants and their natural enemies (e.g. insects, fungi and pathogens). Empirical evidence shows that specialized pathogens and pests are attracted to areas of high host plant density, which may strongly affect plant growth and survival. This phenomonon, in part, motivates agriculturalists to perform crop rotations, which can keep natural enemies (soil pathogens) at bay. While specialized pests and pathogens are often a nuisance and threat in the anthropocentric world of agriculture, they may have profound and fascinating implications for species interactions in the natural world.\nIn particular, observations show that specialized natural enemies reduce the survival of juvenile plants (e.g. seedlings) when they are near conspecific adult trees. These phenomena are often referred to as ``Janzen-Connell effects’’ (JCEs), named after the scientists who proposed the idea. JCEs are thought to promote coexistence by generating so-called negative frequency dependence: as a species becomes more common, its offspring experience JCEs in a larger proportion of the environment. This reduces the success of common species relative to rare species, which facilitates species coexistence.\n A visualization of JCEs and empirical evidence. (A) shows how JCEs occur. [1] Consider a focal species, the green tree. It locally disperses some of its offspring. [2] Heterospecific species disperse some of their offspring to the area as well. Color indicates species. [3] Janzen Connell Effects refer to the observation that either the presence of the adult tree, the relatively high density of its nearby offspring, or a combination of these factors attracts specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores or fugal pathogens. [4] The presence of these specialized natural enemies reduce the survival of our focal species’ nearby offspring (most often during the seed-to-seedling transition). [5] The key idea is that when the adult occupying the patch dies and [6] the remaining individuals compete for the gap, the relatively high mortality our focal green species experienced makes it [7] less likely than the other species to colonize the patch (at least relative to when this processes doesn’t occur). (B) and (C) show empirical evidence from Comita et al. 2014 and Song et al. 2021 that seedling mortality tends to increase in areas of high density and/or near conspecific adults. \nHowever, the efficacy of this mechanism remains contested on theoretical grounds. Much of my PhD work focused on elucidating how and when JCEs are theoretically expected to maintain species richness. For example, JCEs are expected to decrease the survival of conspecific offspring near adults. How exactly does survival change with conspecific adult distance and density? The below figure shows four different assumptions common in theoretical models and statistical fits of JCEs (in which redder shading indicates stronger JCEs / higher mortality). As it turns out, the ability of JCEs to maintain species richness strongly depends on which distance and density dependent functional forms are assumed. See my published work for more details on this project.\n Visualizations of different JCE function forms with respect to adult conspecific density and distance.  Link to article published in Ecology Letters\nMore recently, I have investigated how the simultaneous occurance of JCEs and abiotic habitat hetergeneity affect species richness and how JCEs decay with space and time with a group of excellent collaborators.\nI am currently collaborating with Dr. Annette Ostling and Dr. Brian Sedio. We are integrating analyses of secondary metabolite data from leaves (which correlate with pathogen resistance) with theoretical modeling to examine how the network of pathogen resistance similarity/dissimilarity between tree species shapes species richness in forest communities throughout the world.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In ecology, researchers often talk about two types of competition: exploitative competition and interference competition. Exploitative competition refers indirect competition between (or within) species for mutually shared resources. Interference competition refers to direct interactions between organisms (e.g., stealing resources in contests, territoriality, stabbing and toxin-antitoxin systems in microbes).\nThe majority of “mechanistic” models and theories in community ecology – such as R* theory and the R* rule – emphasize exploitative competition and ignore interference competition. In contrast, the Hawk-Dove game from evolutionary game theory is a classic model in which interference competition is emphasized. Similarly, the competition-colonization trade-off is a classic coexistence mechanism in theoretical community ecology which implicitly relies on interference competition, at least within certain interpretations. However, R* theory, the Hawk-Dove game, and the competition-colonization trade-off have not been integrated into a unified framework.\n (A) is a visualization of the model, depicting a single species that consumes resources and engages in contests over resources. (B) shows parameter space in which interference competition may permit coexistence of two consumer species competing for a single limiting resource (first row) and the predominant mechanism underlying the competitive outcome (second row).  Link to article on BioRxiv\nIn our recent paper currently under review, Dr. Joanna Masel and I expand a simple exploitative consumer-resource model to include interference competition over resources. As depicted in the figure below, we consider a model in which one individuals (e.g., the deer) may contest others over the use of resources. Through this model, we find that two consumer species can persist on a single limiting resource due to interference (in contrast to classical ecological theory such as the R* rule). We find that some of the parameter space resembles the R* rule, other parts resemble the Hawk-Dove game, and other parts the competition-colonization trade-off. We also find evidence of novel coexistence mechanism which we refer to as the “submission-discovery” trade-off.\nIn upcoming work, we will expand this model to include trait evolution. We aim to elucidate how interference competition modifies niche evolution and character displacement."
